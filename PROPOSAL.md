## Project Description

I plan to create a job recruitment site where users can fill out their profiles and create an online resume where they can list their experiences and skills for recruiters to peruse.

There will initially be 3 pages:

1 - The job listing page: where jobs are displayed and users can apply. This will be the initial landing page where the viewer must sign up to access other functions. If they're logged in, once the user clicks apply to a job, the apply button will grey out and they can not apply again, however they can withdraw their application and it will be reflected on the employer's side.
</br>
2 - The profile page: For users to enter their information. Edit functionalities will only be available to the users, while employers can only view the page.
</br>
3 - The employer dashboard: Where employers can enter their job information and view active posts. In this area, they will be able to see a list of names on each posts where they can click on a name and it shall be linked to the user's profile page.

If the viewer is a user, they will be able to create their profiles and browse available job listings. The user can then apply for jobs where their clickable name will be displayed on the employerâ€™s side.

If the viewer is an employer, they will be able to post/delete job listings and view users who expressed interests in their job posts.
